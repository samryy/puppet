##  Asenna ja konfiguroi jokin palvelin package-file-service -tyyliin Puppetilla.

I created the reguired folders for the Puppet module in /etc/puppet/modules/

```
sudo mkdir apache
cd apache
sudo mkdir manifests
sudoedit /etc/puppet/modules/apache/manifests/init.pp

```
I created a Puppet module that will install apache2

```
class apache {
	package {apache2:
		ensure => 'installed',
		allowcdrom => 'true',
	}
  
	file {'/var/www/html/index.html':
		content => "Sami's testsite\n",
		require => Package["apache2"];
}
  
	service {apache2:
		ensure => 'running',
		enable => 'true',
		subscribe => File ['/var/www/html/index.html'],
}


```

The installation was succesfull 

```
